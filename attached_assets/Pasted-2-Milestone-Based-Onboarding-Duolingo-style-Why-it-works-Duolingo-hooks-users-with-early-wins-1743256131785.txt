2. Milestone-Based Onboarding (Duolingo-style)
Why it works:
 Duolingo hooks users with early wins, colorful progress bars, and small rewards—just enough to keep momentum going
How to use it in Web3 (Aura Forge example):
 System Name: The Forge Path
Break the first 24–72 hours of gameplay into mini quests:


“Complete your first farm mission”


“Level up a character”


“Join the community Discord”


Each action gives a tiny reward (XP, lore, items)


Visual tracker or animated scroll (like a battle pass) showing the player’s Forge Journey


Final reward: choose a starter Aura, name it, and mint it as your “Bound Spirit”


Bonus Layer: Add short lore reveals at each stage to emotionally connect the player with the world and their role in it
