Got it. Here's the **revised funnel page wireframe** based on that direction—**no mention of the $2k price**, but with *strategic seeding* of the $10k–$100k deal range and the value of what's being offered. This keeps the mystery, builds intrigue, and makes the CTA feel low-risk but high-reward.

This is an **entry point**  
A shortcut into the collaboration  
An invitation to earn your spot in our network  
A chance to implement a *lightweight version* of the full system—and start seeing momentum before investing heavy resources

**We don’t sell this publicly**  
We offer it to founders who we believe have serious potential  
Which is why you’re seeing this
